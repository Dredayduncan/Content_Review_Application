# Content_Review_Application

A web application aimed at allowing upcoming content creators to gain exposure and appreciation for their work faster and easier. Any user without signing up on the site may search and view the profiles of creators on the site. A ‘signed up’ user is able to save their favourite creators by adding them to their ‘favourites’. They can also view the history pages they have visited. A user after viewing a creator’s page may rate that user to give them feedback. A creator upon signing up may edit their profile by updating the bio, social media handles and the images and videos of their work they want users to see. Though signed in as creators, they may also view and rate the works of other creators on the site.

The website can be viewed at: https://creatordiscovery.000webhostapp.com
